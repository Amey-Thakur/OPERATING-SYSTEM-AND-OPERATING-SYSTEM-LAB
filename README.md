<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## 📖 Overview

**Operating System (CSC405)** explores the fundamental concepts of operating systems, including process management, memory optimization, file systems, and input/output handling. It provides a deep dive into how software manages hardware resources.

**Operating System Lab (CSL404)** focuses on the practical implementation of these concepts, involving shell scripting, system calls, and simulation of CPU scheduling algorithms using C and Python.

This repository serves as a centralized archive of **Laboratory Experiments**, **Assignments**, **Reference Books**, and **Examination Preparation Materials**.

> 💝 **Special Thanks**: A heartfelt thank you to Mega for her constant support, patience, and clarity throughout this journey. Learning alongside her made a real difference, not only because she explained concepts so clearly, but because she truly cared about understanding them together. Her thoughtful approach to teaching, openness to discussion, and steady encouragement turned challenges into meaningful learning moments. This work reflects the growth that came from learning side by side. Thank you, Mega, for everything you shared and taught along the way.

> [!NOTE]
> **COVID-19 Impact**: This coursework was completed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Due to the nationwide lockdown and the sudden transition to online learning, several planned laboratory sessions and collaborative note-taking activities could not be carried out as originally intended. Despite these challenges, efforts were made to adapt and preserve as much work as possible. The limited chapter notes in this section reflect the disruption caused by the pandemic, rather than a lack of effort or commitment.
