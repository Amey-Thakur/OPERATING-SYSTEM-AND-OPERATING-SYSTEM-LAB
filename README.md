                                     OVERVIEW SECTION
     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Operating System (CSC405) and Operating System Lab (CSL404) are core subjects in the Second Year (Semester IV) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. These courses provide foundational knowledge of operating system concepts, including process management, memory optimization, file systems, and input/output handling.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key domains in operating systems:

- **Process Management**: Processes, threads, scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, SRTN, RR)
- **Synchronization**: Critical section problem, semaphores, monitors, classic problems of synchronization
- **Deadlocks**: Prevention, avoidance, detection, and recovery
- **Memory Management**: Paging, segmentation, virtual memory, page replacement algorithms
- **File Systems**: File concepts, access methods, directory structure, protection
- **I/O Systems**: I/O hardware, application I/O interface, kernel I/O subsystem
- **Disk Scheduling**: FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN algorithms

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, assignments, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As I progress in my career, I recognize that OS fundamentals remain essential for systems programming, backend development, and cloud computing. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental OS concepts.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through OS and OS Lab.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.

> [!TIP]
> **Process Visualization**: Always draw process state diagrams and Gantt charts on paper before coding scheduling algorithms. Trace through each time quantum, calculate waiting/turnaround times step-by-step, and visualize memory allocation patterns. Understanding the underlying state transitions and resource allocation is essential for implementing efficient OS simulations.
