<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## Overview

Operating System (CSC405) and Operating System Lab (CSL404) are core subjects in the Second Year (Semester IV) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. These courses provide foundational knowledge of operating system concepts, including process management, memory optimization, file systems, and input/output handling.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key domains in operating systems:

- **Process Management**: Processes, threads, scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, SRTN, RR)
- **Synchronization**: Critical section problem, semaphores, monitors, classic problems of synchronization
- **Deadlocks**: Prevention, avoidance, detection, and recovery
- **Memory Management**: Paging, segmentation, virtual memory, page replacement algorithms
- **File Systems**: File concepts, access methods, directory structure, protection
- **I/O Systems**: I/O hardware, application I/O interface, kernel I/O subsystem
- **Disk Scheduling**: FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN algorithms

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, assignments, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As I progress in my career, I recognize that OS fundamentals remain essential for systems programming, backend development, and cloud computing. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental OS concepts.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through OS and OS Lab.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.

> 💝 **Special Thanks**: A heartfelt thank you to Mega for her constant support, patience, and clarity throughout this journey. Learning alongside her made a real difference, not only because she explained concepts so clearly, but because she truly cared about understanding them together. Her thoughtful approach to teaching, openness to discussion, and steady encouragement turned challenges into meaningful learning moments. This work reflects the growth that came from learning side by side. Thank you, Mega, for everything you shared and taught along the way.

> [!NOTE]
> **COVID-19 Impact**: This coursework was completed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Due to the nationwide lockdown and the sudden transition to online learning, several planned laboratory sessions and collaborative note-taking activities could not be carried out as originally intended. Despite these challenges, efforts were made to adapt and preserve as much work as possible. The limited chapter notes in this section reflect the disruption caused by the pandemic, rather than a lack of effort or commitment.
